# Sparse Inference in Poisson Log-Normal Model

## Description
This repository contains R source for implementating the analysis described in the article "Sparse inference in Poisson log-normal model by approximating the L0-norm." 
The analysis focuses on variable selection and on providing useful/interpretable graphical outputs.
## Features
- Implementation of sparse inference methods in the Poisson log-normal model and scripts to perform sparse inference.
- Pipeline analysis: Modify the data file paths in the scripts to analyze different datasets.
- Demonstration scripts: Show how to perform the entire analysis, including data preprocessing, model fitting, and extracting graphical results.

## Usage
To use the scripts in the `pipeline_analysis` folder, please refer to the README included in that folder for detailed instructions.
